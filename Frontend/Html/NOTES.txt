Tag :  a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML document.

Element : a component of an HTML document that tells a web browser how to structure and interpret a part of the HTML document. It consists of a starting tag, content, and an end tag.

Attributes : provide additional information about elements, Attributes are always specified in the start tag, Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".

Use </p> when your paragraph contains text/content.
Use <p/> only in React/JSX for empty paragraphs (rarely needed).

how web works : You → Browser → DNS → Server → Response → Browser → Rendered Web Page
When you enter a URL, the browser finds the website’s IP using DNS, sends a request to the server, gets back HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, then renders and displays the page.

Inline : Elements don’t start on a new line and only take up as much width as needed (e.g., <span>, <a>).

Block : Elements start on a new line and take up the full width (e.g., <div>, <p>).

Inline-Block : Like inline (doesn’t break line), but allows setting width, height, padding, and margin (e.g., good for buttons).

Div : The <div> element is widely used because it's a generic block-level container that offers several advantages:
- Flexible layout control: Works well with CSS for styling, positioning, and layout (Grid, Flexbox, etc.).
- No semantic meaning: Ideal when no specific HTML tag fits, making it a neutral wrapper.
- Grouping content: Useful for grouping related elements to apply common styles or logic.
- JavaScript interaction: Easy to select and manipulate with JavaScript for dynamic behavior.
In short: <div> gives you full control over layout and styling without enforcing any built-in behavior.
